# Bike Sharing Assignment
> The Linear regression model for bike sharing assignment


## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- What is the background of your project?
- You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 
- The data set we used here is day.csv


## Conclusions
- #### Conclusion #####

# The positive coefficients imply the factors which, on increasing, would lead to the increase in count and the negative coefficients imply that the factors with negative coeff. on increase, would lead to the decrease in total count.
# By looking at the equation, we can imply that temperature is a major deciding factor of the count followed by the year and season (Winter and summer), where the curve is with positive coefficient.

# The rental count drops during holidays and fall season ####
